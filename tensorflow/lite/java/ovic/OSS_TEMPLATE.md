## Benchmark Results

### [4th OVIC Public Ranked Leaderboard](https://lpcvc.ecn.purdue.edu/score_board_r4/?contest=round4)
#### Image Classification (from the Leaderboard)
|Rank|Username|Latency|Accuracy on Classified|# Classified|Accuracy/Time|Metric|Reference Accuracy|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|Username|xx.x|0.xxxx|20000.0|xxx|0.xxxxx|0.xxxxx|

 * **Metric**: Accuracy improvement over the reference accuracy from the Pareto optimal curve
 * **Accuracy on Classified**: The accuracy in [0, 1] computed based only on the images classified within the wall-time
 * **\# Classified**: The number of images classified within the wall-time
 * **Accuracy/Time**: The accuracy divided by either the total inference time or the wall-time, whichever is longer
 * **Reference accuracy**: The reference accuracy of models from the Pareto optimal curve that have the same latency as the submission

#### Object Detection
|Rank|Username|Metric|Runtime|mAP over time|mAP of processed|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|Username|0.xxxxx|xxx.x|xxx|xxx|
* **Metric**: COCO mAP computed on the entire minival dataset
* **mAP over time**: COCO mAP on the minival dataset divided by latency per image
* **mAP of processed**: COCO mAP computed only on the processed images
